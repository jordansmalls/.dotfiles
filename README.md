# 2025

navigating the path of minimalism and productivity optimization has been quite fun. from creating shortcuts within raycast for instantaneous app switching with no animations on macOS, to hiding distractive UI elements in various applications, i firmly believe that building a development environment designed for success benefits ~~all~~ most devs.

one thing i am sure of, is that all files within this repo are subject to change. maybe soon, i will expose my linux config files and share my environment to unlock the 10x dev in everyone. (sarcasm) if you have not yet veered down the "ricing" road, i advise picking tried and true tools (*vscode, chrome or firefox, and your OS's default terminal*) and just getting started. ship. that's what matters anyway.

## .zshrc

my .zshrc config only includes the aliases i currently use. depending on the machine, there are p10k, bun, and nvm paths here as well. i also use *oh-my-zsh* for better autocompletion, plugins, and some preconfigured aliases.

## settings.json

for whenever i actually use vscode, i do not want to see all the extra UI elements that waste screen space. who actually uses the minimap? read your errors. my settings.json file contains customizations for a very minimal vscode experience that saves screen real estate, along with some general configs for extensions from when i used to daily drive vscode. if you have not entered the rabbit hole of tailoring every bit of your dev experience, don't.

## ghostty conf

ghostty is great. it's lightweight, fast, and streamlines workflow with its auto-suggestions and intelligent navigation, all within a minimalistic interface. my ghostty config contains a simple setup for the ghostty terminal emulator. this is subject to change, as i set it up within 10 minutes on a lunch break. finally, a terminal that builds on the successes of other projects while supporting native OS features. i love the fast startup time, native feature support, and, of course, that extra screen real estate baby. ghostty is an awesome project overall. warp was fun, but who wants to sign into their terminal?

## hammerspoon

hammerspoon is a very cool automation tool for macOS that allows you to extend control of your machine through scripts written in lua. it's considered the swiss army knife of macOS productivity. so far, i have only used it for remapping keys (shift + cmd + 1 jumps to terminal, for example), but i know hammerspoon has the power for window management and much more. i plan to revisit it after testing raycast, which lets me set up shortcuts and replace macOS's native "spotlight." the hammerspoon directory contains a README.md explaining the shortcuts within the init.lua file and the init.lua file itself for configuration.

## neovim

once i finish my linux configs, i will share my vimrc. on work machines, i use lazyvim.

## browsers

this was a shameful rabbit hole to go down. i prefer chromium-based browsers for reasons you can find on my blog, but in short i want a browsing experience that is ***minimal.*** currently, i am using zen browser. its "zen mods" are quite cool, and it provides the minimal experience i want without much configuration. but it is firefox-based. arc browser is dead, vivaldi didn't quite hit the mark, brave is becoming as bloated as netscape and edge did not allow for the customization i needed. so, zen browser it is.

i tried, firefox is bad, back to chrome i go.

## the short list

#### editor
- neovim/vscode

#### terminal
- ghostty
- zsh (oh-my-zsh)
- tmux (oh-my-tmux)
- nvm

#### browser
- chrome
- arc (for some casual browsing)

#### linux
- fedora 40 w/ i3 (desktop)
- arch (laptop)

#### general
- notion
- excalidraw

let's see how this changes.
